Individualized single-subject networks from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features such as:
  - Cortical thickness.
  - Gray matter density.
  - Subcortical morphometric features.
  - Gyrification and curvature. 

Applicable for whenever network-level features are useful, among which common use cases are: 
 - Biomarker development.
 - Brain-behaviour relationships (e.g. for the diagnosis and prognosis of many brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia and the like).
 - Aging (changes in network properties over age and their relations to other variables).
