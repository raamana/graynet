About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``graynet`` helps you easily extract single-subject network-level features from T1-weighted mri features, as well as ROI-wise statistics, such as:

  - Cortical thickness, Gyrification, Curvature, Sulcal depth etc
  - Gray/white matter density, or any other voxel-wise feature
  - Subcortical morphometric features

Applicable for whenever network-level features are useful, among which common use cases are:

 - Biomarker development
 - Brain-behaviour relationships e.g. for the diagnosis and prognosis of many brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia and the like
 - Aging (changes in network properties over age and their relations to other variables)
 - and any other applications wherein single-subject networks and ROI-stats are helpful.

Applicability
-------------

This package can aid in understanding brain function (relationship of GM network-level features with behaviour) and in imaging biomarker development for the detection of many brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia and the like.
