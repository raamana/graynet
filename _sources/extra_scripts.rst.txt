Convenience/useful scripts
--------------------------------

To automate the the process of generating the above job files and their submission for processing on HPC clusters, I have included a `script <https://github.com/raamana/graynet/blob/master/scripts/generate_hpc_jobs.py>`_ . Please read the instructions inside and run it.

There are few other convenience scripts in the `scripts <https://github.com/raamana/graynet/blob/master/scripts/>`_ folder - take a look and feel free to modify for your tasks.
