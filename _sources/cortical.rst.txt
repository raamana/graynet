Cortical graynet
-------------------

For the cortical stream of processing, ``graynet`` relies on outputs from Freesurfer processing. If you processed your data (to produce thickness values), just resample them on fsaverage atlas and store it in a format readable by ``nibabel`` package.

The following steps should help you get started and going quickly:

    - Ensure Freesurfer processing is complete
        - It is **highly** recommended that you perform quality control on the Freesurfer outputs before you use them for analysis. This QC is quite easy now using `visualqc <https://raamana.github.io/visualqc/readme.html>`_
    - Ensure you ran ``recon-all`` with ``-qcache`` flag choosing atleast one FWHM value (10 is the default). If not already run, it is quick to rerun on existing Freesurfer processing.
    - check :ref:`run_fs` for more details.

If graynet is installed without error, you should have ``graynet`` command in your path. Just type ``graynet`` and you should see it display options and usage instructions, as presented in :doc:`usage_cli` page.

Suppose say

  - you already have Freesurfer processing done at ``/work/project/freesurfer_reconall``
  - for 5 subjects with identifiers are stored in subject_ids.txt (one per line)
  - you want to analyze network features based on cortical thickness values, which have been resampled on fsaverage surface (which is the default) at smoothing level of FWHM 10 (default)
  - use the ``manhattan`` method to compute histogram distance between two cortical ROIs (assuming all subjects resampled to same atlas)
  - and store the networks extracted in /work/project/graynet

You could achieve it all with a single command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /work/project
    graynet -s subject_ids.txt -f freesurfer_thickness -i /work/project/freesurfer_reconall -w manhattan -a fsaverage -p 10 -o /work/project/graynet

That's it! By the time you can get your coffee or stretch your legs, you should have graynet processing done.

Suppose, you prefer to analyze ROIs as defined by a multimodal parcellation published in Glasser 2016 atlas and also curious to try multiple weight metrics -  ``chebyshev`` and ``cosine``, you can achieve it via the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /work/project
    graynet -s subject_ids.txt -f freesurfer_thickness -i /work/project/freesurfer_reconall -w manhattan chebyshev cosine -a Glasser2016 -p 10 -o /work/project/graynet

You could also study curvature and sulcal depth features by simply adding more features to the ``-f``, such as ``freesurfer_curv`` and ``freesurfer_sulc``.

However, if you have 100s of subjects or your atlas has a large number of ROIs (like the Glasser 2016 which has 360), this computation can take a long time. It is advisable to move the processing to a larger server or computer cluster, by delegating few subjects to a single job. You could leverage this `script <https://github.com/raamana/graynet/blob/master/scripts/generate_hpc_jobs.py>`_ to process any large dataset at once (produce jobs for processing on a cluster).

    - If you have access to a computer cluster, you can submit the generated jobs to the cluster.
    - If you don't have access to a cluster, you could still use the generated job/script files to run them locally - few at a time.

After processing is done (on the cluster or locally), and assuming no other errors, you should see a CSV file for each subject, with ``n*(n-1)/2`` values corresponding to the upper-triangular part of the connectivity matrix, where n is the number of ROIs in a atlas you chose (68 for fsaverage or 360 for Glasser2016).

The output folder will be graynet within ``proc_dir`` you choose in the script - determined by this statement in the above script:

.. code-block:: python

    out_dir = pjoin(proc_dir, 'graynet', '{}_{}_fwhm{}_range{}_{}_nbins{}'.format(base_feature, atlas, fwhm, edge_range[0], edge_range[1], num_bins))


which after expansion looks something like based on your choices: ``/your_proc_dir/graynet/freesurfer_thickness_GLASSER2016_fwhm10_range0_5_nbins25/``



.. _roi_stats:

Computing ROI-wise statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``graynet`` also helps you compute ROI-wise statistics (individual, not pair-wise) for visualization (median thickness in PCG), as well as to serve as a baseline for network-level features. Use the ``-r`` or ``--roi_stats`` flag to achieve it. Only one type of processing (ROI stats, or network-level features) can be done at a time.


.. _run_fs:

How to run Freesurfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are new to Freesurfer, please:

    - follow this `beginners guide <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferBeginnersGuide>`_
    - leverage various `options <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-all>`_ available
    - include ``-qcache`` flag choosing atleast one FWHM value (10 is the default) - see :ref:`qcache_flag`.
    - process the subjects till "recon-all is finished without error"

In typical scenarios (when T1 mri scans do not *special* processing to handle any artefacts), running Freesurfer would boil down to running command:

.. code-block:: bash

    recon-all -all -sd /project/processed/freesurfer -subjid ABC_0001 -i /project/raw/ABC_0001/mri.nii -qcache

.. _qcache_flag:

Qcache recon-all flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Qcache recon-all flag does the following:

    - resample data (e.g. thickness, curv, sulc) onto the average subject (called fsaverage)
    - smooth it at a range of FWHM (full-width/half-max) values, usually 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25mm.

We encourage the use of default behaviour (simple inclusion of ``-qcache``), which will smooth the surface data for thickness, curv, sulc, area and jacobian_white at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm FWHM.

If you are interested in resampling the data on to a different atlas or process features outside Freesurfer structure, check https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/qcache for more info.

The parcellation for the `Glasser et al 2016 <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature18933.html>`_ atlas has been resampled onto the fsaverage space already, courtesy of `Kathryn Mills <https://figshare.com/articles/HCP-MMP1_0_projected_on_fsaverage/3498446>`_.
